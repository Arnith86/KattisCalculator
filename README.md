# KattisCalculator

This repository contains my solution to the Kattis problem [**Calculator**](https://open.kattis.com/problems/calculator).

This problem was a real challenge. My initial solution ran into several issues, and I had to do some research to properly implement operator precedence and correctly handle mathematical expressions. It was a great learning experience!
